## Contributing

We ❤️ contributors. Please be sure to read our [CODE OF CONDUCT](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT).

At a high-level, this monorepo is split up into 4 project subdirectories:

1. `app/` — the Left on Read Electron application itself that is not dependent on anything in `server/` or `web/`. (Remember: the app does not even connect to the Internet.)
2. `web/` - the marketing site.
3. `eslint-config/` - a shared eslint config to maintain consistency.

Please see each project's README for more information.
