A free open-source iMessage analyzer for Mac Desktop. Built with Electron, SQLite, Typescript, and ‚ù§Ô∏è.

### Mission and Values

**üë©üèªOpen-Source Transparency**: We open-sourced the entire application to keep users' security and privacy first.

**Fast**: The first iteration was a [web application](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/biou3e/4_years_of_texts_between_me_and_my_long_distance/), but now we have rebuilt Left on Read as a desktop application that works without an Internet connection.

**Secure**: Without needing to manually re-upload, you can now use Left on Read securely and learn about yourself from your texts.
