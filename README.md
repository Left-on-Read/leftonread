## Mission and Values

**Open-Source Transparency**: We open-sourced the entire application to keep users' security and privacy first.

**Secure**: Just like your private photos and important documents, your text messages are only accessible to you and never seen by us.

**Productive and Fun**: The first iteration was a [web application](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/biou3e/4_years_of_texts_between_me_and_my_long_distance/), but now we have rebuilt Left on Read as a Desktop app to feature fun productivity tools, such as scheduled messages and reminders.
