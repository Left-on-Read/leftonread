## Local Development

We are proud to be using [Electron-React Boilerplate
](https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/). They have fantastic documentation that covers the basics, including how to add tests and package the application. Read all of their docs first.

### Quick Start

1. Install packages with `yarn`
2. Run the application with `yarn start`

## Contributing

<!-- TODO: Move this to a CONTRIBUTING.md -->

### Code Style

- Use `electron-log` for logging
- Keep files small

## Troubleshooting Local Development:

#### DATABASE MALFORMED â€” TRIGGER ERROR

If you see a console error that says the database is malformed, then you need to delete the databases the application reads from (so then it can create them from scratch again)

1. `cd ~/.leftonread`
2. `rm -r AddressBookFolder chat.db chat.db-shm chat.db-wal`

#### ENOENT: no such file or directory

If you see:

```
Reading /Users/.../node_modules/devtron/manifest.json failed.
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory.
```

You most likely have an old electron process running. If this is warning, you can ignore it. Otherwise, kill the old process.
